# Formula-Engine-in-Python

In this assignment, I have created 2 variable formula engine and 3 variable Formula engine.

Module used:

1.Parser:
Introduction to Python Parser.Parsing is defined as the processing of a piece of python program and converting these codes into machine language. In general, we can say parse is a command for dividing the given program code into a small piece of code for analyzing the correct syntax.

**parser.expr(source)** The expr() function parses the parameter source as if it were an input to compile(source, 'file.py', 'eval'). If the parse succeeds, an ST object is created to hold the internal parse tree representation, otherwise an appropriate exception is raised.

2. math : for simple mathematical calculations.

3. eval: When st represents an 'eval' form, this function returns true, otherwise it returns false
